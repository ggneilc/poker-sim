<h1> FreePlay - The most fair casino platform online </h1>
---

Freeplay is designed with statistical distribution in mind to keep the rate of cards coming truly random, so players don't have to get angry or not trust the platform they are playing on; You can just play and worry about your odds against your opponents.

We plan to support popular card casino games, including:
- Texas Hold'em
- Blackjack
- Craps
- Roulette
- Baccarat
- And more!

Each game will have its own verifiyable random distribution so players can see that what they are getting is all up to luck, and the outcome is based on their skill. 

FreePlay is also in the name: We do not plan on being an actual monetary online casino; There are just no good options for playing a modern rendition of the most popular casino games. We will include ledgers in each room to track the flow of bets, so friends playing for real money will need to handle payment outside the game in a 3rd party payment system (Zelle, Cashapp, etc.)

This may be changed in the future to allow for a centralized collection of bets and payments, but we do not intend to be a house; paying out players in blackjack, etc.
